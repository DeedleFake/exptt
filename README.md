ExPTT
=====

_Note: This is still under development. It does not work yet._

ExPTT is an Elixir rewrite of [ptt-fix](https://github.com/DeedleFake/ptt-fix). It can monitor your Linux input devices and send events to the X root window when certain events happen. In so doing, it can provide a way to get around the lack of push-to-talk support in Wayland.
